The rules
=========

This game is meant to be played by two players. Each player starts with 8 balls of the same color and will need to
eliminate either the totality of the other player balls either 6 of the red neutral ones.

Every turn the player can push one of his balls, but he needs to have enough space to place his finger behind it.
They are a few rules concerning which balls can be pushed:

* The player cannot push one of his own balls outside the plateau.
* The player cannot undo his opponent last move.
* The ball must have a blank space next to it in the opposite direction to be pushed this way.
